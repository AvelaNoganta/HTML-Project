			<p>Springbok is a type of antelope that belongs to the bovid family. There are 3 subspecies of springbok that can be found in southern and southwestern parts of Africa. Springbok inhabits open plains, grasslands, scrublands, deserts and semi-arid areas. Uncontrolled hunting (because of their meat and skin) and construction of the fences (which prevent seasonal migrations) led to drastic reduction in the number of springboks in the wild. Luckily, population of springboks is still large and stable and they are not on the list of endangered species.</p>
